# Mobile-Prices-Classification-With-AWS-Sagemaker

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of creating and deploying a machine learning model to classify mobile phone prices using AWS SageMaker. The project follows a step-by-step approach, from data preparation to model deployment. The classification problem involves predicting the price range of mobile phones based on their features.
